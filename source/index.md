### Pray about joining our Wycliffe partnership team

Your financial contribution enables me to use my skills as a computer
programmer to share the Good News with those who have never heard the name
of Jesus Christ.

## I am entirely self-funded

I cannot make my contribution to this world-wide effort until I have raised
100% of my financial support.

No amount is insignificant. All generosity is celebrated. You will help 
prepare the world for Christ's return. 

### Please join us in cultivating biblical and computer literacy around the world.
