### I am a computer programmer and Wycliffe Bible Translator

God creates with his words <sup>[Genesis 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+1&version=NLT)</sup>. Christ is the Word made Flesh<sup>[John 1:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1&version=NLT)</sup>. His Spirit is with us when our own words do not suffice<sup>[Romans 8:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8&version=NLT)</sup>. We are created in the image of God and have capacity to create like God<sup>[Genesis 11:1-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+11%3A1-9&version=NLT)</sup>. His image enables the author and the artist to create worlds of their own. He calls faithful servants and equips them to write a better story of the fallen world entrusted into our care.

### Computer programming is how I exercise my God-given creativity

God has called me to apply my skills as a programmer in carrying out the Great Commission. There is simply no better use of my time on earth. It is a privilege to join other Wycliffe Bible Translators around the world, because wherever Scripture goes, life gets better. The stories get better. My own life is a testament to that. 

### So what do I actually do?

A computer programmer is a writer. In the simplest terms, programmers write instructions for machines in computer languages. As with pen and paper, computers and their languages provide a powerful mode of self expression. You need not look far to see examples. Typically, computer programmers are called to solve problems. These may be exotic problems only of interest to academics, or practical mundane problems concerning finance, administration, or organizational processes.

Wycliffe has set out to solve a practical problem. This problems is far from mundane. We bring people the Scriptures so that they can read and hear God's Word in their own language. Ours is a global effort and there are countless opportunities for a programmer to solve problems. Where Scripture goes, a better story is told. The need for Good News is urgent. 

### I make things faster and easier 

God called me to Wycliffe to serve and to help write a better story. When God fills 100% of my budget, I will likely contribute to the [Scripture Forge Project](https://scriptureforge.org/). This is a natural fit for my first assignment, as my programming specialization is _Web Application Development_. I have a made a career out of delivering software over the World Wide Web. This is only my first assignment. There are no shortage of opportunities to apply computing in carrying out the Great Commission and everyone can contribute. [Your generosity](/partner) is a powerful catalyst in enhancing and extending the Kingdom of God. By joining in this work, your story is told for eternity.

### God's peace,

## Dan
