### I am a computer programmer and [Wycliffe Bible Translator](https://www.wycliffe.ca/)

God creates with his words <sup>[Genesis 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+1&version=NLT)</sup>. Christ is the Word made Flesh<sup>[John 1:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1&version=NLT)</sup>. His Spirit is with us when our own words do not suffice<sup>[Romans 8:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8&version=NLT)</sup>. We are created in the image of God and have capacity to create like God<sup>[Genesis 11:1-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+11%3A1-9&version=NLT)</sup>. His image enables the author and the artist to create worlds of their own. He calls faithful servants and equips them to write a better story of the fallen world entrusted into our care.

### Pray about joining our Wycliffe partnership team

Your financial contribution enables me to use my skills as a computer
programmer to share the Good News with those who have never heard the name
of Jesus Christ.

## I am entirely self-funded

I cannot make my contribution to this world-wide effort until I have raised
100% of my financial support.

No amount is insignificant. All generosity is celebrated. You will help 
prepare the world for Christ's return. 

### Please join us in cultivating biblical and computer literacy around the world.
