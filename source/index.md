### I am a computer programmer and Wycliffe Bible Translator

At Wycliffe we understand the importance of a person's _heart language_. This is the first language you learn as a child. It shapes your ideas and understanding of the world. As such, it is the language through which the truth can best be delivered and received.

My first language is English, but it is not my heart language. Though I learned the truth through the Scriptures, I only submitted to Christ because of the truth revealed through my heart discipline, Computer Science.

This often seems strange to people who ask me what I do at Wycliffe. Explaining how computing shapes my ideas and understanding of the world is difficult to translate for people who don't speak my language.

### This website is where I share what I know about computing and the Bible.

The _science_ of Computer Science is in determining which problems are _computable_. That is, which problems can be encompassed and expressed in a language made for machines. I can only speak and understand English, but I have many heart languages.

Computer programmers are writers. Like novelists, we create worlds with our words, but in a more powerful and often more literal sense. 

To understand the importance of computing and the role it plays in delivering God's truth through the Scriptures, you must speak my language. Computer programming is a higher form of literacy.

### As a Bible translator, I cultivate biblical and computer literacy around the world

When computing is applied in carrying out the Great Commission, a new bar is set for literacy. Not everyone will immediately understand, but everyone can [join in this work](/partner). Your generosity is powerful ammunition in enhancing and extending the Kingdom of God.

### God's peace,

## Dan
