The Scripture changed my life. Long before I knew Jesus, his word was delivered through Jack Chick comic book Bible tracts I found at the bus stop. What first seemed silly and offensive eventually rewrote my story on earth in way that will be told in eternity. I am a witness-to and proof-of the power of God's Word. 

There are many people who know a different _Danny_. Most people call me _Dan_ now. I'm the same person I've always been, but still _different_ somehow. There no greater wisdom can be attained apart from fearing God and measuring your own heart and mind against the stories told by witnesses in the Bible. This is what sets Dan apart from Danny... though I am badly tainted, my life reflects God's truth.

It's been fifteen years since I submitted my life to Jesus Christ. I have been called to extend Christ's offer of eternal life to those who believe Jesus to be silly and offensive. Or worse, have never even heard of Him.

My name is Daniel Bidulock. I am computer programmer and Wycliffe Bible Translator.

When God's Word takes root in your heart, you see the world more clearly. You see God at work everywhere. For me, it was immediately evident in music, movies, and television... none of which were _Christian_. To this day I point to the truths revealed to my by _The Matrix_, _Fight Club_, and a wonderful Canadian film called _Cube 2 - Hypercube_.

God's truth was further reinforced through my academic studies in Computer Science... nothing is random, and infinity belongs to God. We create like God with our words. This is true of all people, though perhaps in a less literal sense than when executed by someone who speaks the languages of machines. My graduate research in artificial intelligence was motivated largely by the romantic notion of creating a computer being in my own tarnished image. Day by day, this notion is getting less romatic and provides fertile ground for new points of theological discussion.

Though I'm able to speak at length on such things, my first Wycliffe assignment is purely pragmatic. Wycliffe has an immediate need for Web Developers. By God's provision, I've been teaching Web Development for the last three years and am a master of my trade. Programmers write _software_ for computers. Web Developers are specialized in that we deliver software over the World Wide Web. Wycliffe has an urgent need for Web Developers. My first assignment will be a Web application called Scripture Forge. You can learn more about it at https://scriptureforge.org.

It used to take 25 years on average to produce a complete translation of the Bible into a new language. With the advent of machines, it now takes about ten. In practical terms, my job at Wycliffe is to make Bible translation faster and easier. The need for Web Developers is motivated by the urgent need of people who don't know that God loves them. No Scripture, no salvation... no Bible comics at the bus stop. This is deeply unsettling, because memories of the old _Danny_ are still fresh.

As Christ's followers, it is our job to testify to God's sacrifice to people all around the world. No one is exempt from this duty. It is a great privilege to be called to apply my God-given skills with Wycliffe. Greater still that I get to hear good stories first-hand of individual lives changed and entire communities transformed. For me, there is simply no better use of my time on earth.

My call to serve with Wycliffe brings with it an opportunity for others to contribute to the Great Commission. The good stories people tell about how they came to know Christ are enabled by generosity. Money contributed to my mission is money invested in God's work. It has impact on real lives in ways money alone cannot facilitate.

My work as a Bible translator is supported entirely by generous individuals and families. I cannot do my work without your generosity. My work presents an opportunity to contribute to building God's Kingdom. Go to whatdandoes.info and ask God you can join me and Wycliffe in prayer and financial partnership. I am not concerned with the amount you are called to give. God may tell you to pledge $200 per month, or he may tell you to pledge $5 per month. All generosity is celebrated, no matter the amount. And all generosity has a direct impact on bringing hope and improving lives all around the world.
