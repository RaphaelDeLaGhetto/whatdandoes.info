Web Developers write software for delivery over the World Wide Web. Rather than installing software directly on our computers, Web applications are downloaded as needed and used in Web browsers like Google Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. If you use the World Wide Web, you have almost certainly used a Web application. They are ubiquitous in the 21st Century.

## Bible Translation

[Wycliffe Bible Translators of Canada](https://www.wycliffe.ca/) is one of over 100 member organizations in the [Wycliffe Global Alliance](http://www.wycliffe.net). In the Canadian office, headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, one of the many things we do is develop software. This includes tools for translators, apps for literacy, and new writing systems for languages that could not previously be written down. Wycliffe Canada has a long legacy of changing lives by ending Bible poverty.

Bible translation is complex, and every project is unique. [Learn more about the process here](https://www.wycliffe.ca/about/our-work/).

## My first assignment - Scripture Forge

Once my financial support is in place, I am to be assigned to the [Scripture Forge](https://scriptureforge.org/) project. Scripture Forge is to be a Web application used by Bible translators and native language speakers to check the accuracy of a Scripture translation. With it, translators will engage language communities, upload and manage Scripture portions, and allow for asking targeted questions. The data it collects can be imported back into existing software tools used by translators around the world.

My skills as a Web Developer, applied in implementing Scripture Forge, will allow us to do more Scripture translation work, more efficiently, and more economically.

## Scripture Changed my Life

Long before I knew Jesus, his word was delivered through Jack Chick comic book Bible tracts I found at the bus stop. What first seemed silly and offensive eventually rewrote my story in a way that will be told in eternity. I am a witness-to and proof-of the power of Godâ€™s Word.

## Why support Bible translation?

Bible translation demands literacy. In carrying out Christ's Great Commission we equip minority language groups to participate in the 21st Century. Literacy brings education, economy, and equality to people who may otherwise be marginalized.
