Countless lives have been changed by the Scriptures. Here are just a couple
stories about how technology is being used to build the Kingdom of God:

## You can help write stories like these

### Pray about joining our Wycliffe partnership team

Your financial contribution enables me to use my skills as a computer
programmer to share the Good News with those who have never heard the name
of Jesus Christ.

As a [Wycliffe Bible Translator](https://www.wycliffe.ca/), I am entirely self
funded. I cannot make my contribution to this world-wide effort until I have
raised 100% of my financial support.

No amount is insignificant. All generosity is celebrated. You will help 
prepare the world for Christ's return.
