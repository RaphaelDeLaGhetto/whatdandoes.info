# Be Generous because God is generous with you

## Exodus 13:1-3a, 11-15

The Israelite's, led by Moses, have just left Egypt amidst nation-wide tragedy. The lives of every firstborn animal and every firstborn Egyptian had been taken by God in the night. It was this event that finally coerced Pharoah into allowing the Israelite slaves to worship God in the desert without their Egyptian overseers. Having discovered their children dead in the middle of the night, both Pharoah and the Egyptian people urged the Israelite's to leave immediately. They had prepared for this event by packing their bags and preparing food for the journey. Their bread was made without yeast because there would be no time for the dough to rise. God further supplied their exodus by granting them favour in the eyes of their Egyptian neighbours. They were generous in giving jewelry, gold, silver, and clothing to the Israelites in order to hasten their departure. Apart from God's favour, the Egyptians feared more of their people would die if the Israelites lingered any longer.

This event became known as the _Passover_, because God had _passed over_ all the firstborn of Israel.

Today's Old Testament lesson opens with God instructing Moses in light of the Passover. He tells him that the firstborn of every animal and every Israelite belongs to Him. They are to be consecrated, or set apart as per God's command.

Moses, relays God's instruction to Israel. They are to remember the day God set them free from slavery in Egypt. They are to remember how they prepared to leave the moment the opportunity arose. This sacred occassion gives glory to God's immeasurable strength. Moses tells Israel to mark the occasion with a week-long festival called the Festival of Unleavend Bread. Passover is only one day. The festival that follows is seven days. Leaven, that is yeast, isn't even allowed in the house during this time of worship, celebration, and remembrance. 

Though the Israelites had left Egypt, they had not yet entered the land God promised to them. This is before Moses parts the Red Sea while being pursued by Pharoah. Moses tells the Israelites that when they do get Canaan, and God gives them this promised land, they are to set aside their firstborn males. Not only the firstborn of their livestock, but their firstborn sons as well. These animals and people belong to God. The animals are to be sacrificed, with one exception... donkeys may be redeemed by sacrificing a sheep. If you do not redeem the donkey, you must break its neck. Firstborn baby boys must be redeemed. They are allowed no other option.

Moses tells us how to respond when our children ask us about the Festival of Unleavened Bread. When asked what it means, we are to tell our children that we were once slaves in Egypt. We left Egypt by God's strength. Because of Pharoah's stubborness, God killed all the firstborn animals and Egyptians. In remembrance of this, we sacrifice all the firstborn of our flocks. In remembrance of this, we purchase the freedom of our firstborn sons.

You are to celebrate this event and tell the story to your children. God freed Israel from Egypt. Their very existence is a sign of God's strength.



## Luke 2:22-40

Christ's birth was an extraordinarily public event. From the opening of the chapter, Luke tells of Joseph and Mary being compelled to be counted in a census by the government of the time. He tells of shepherds being visited by angels who announce the child's birth.

The angels say,

> “Glory to God in the highest heaven,
>    and on earth peace among those whom he favors!”
> [Luke 2:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+2%3A14&version=NRSV)

Upon hearing this, they rush into Bethlehem to see the child for themselves.

After 8 days, the child is named Jesus and circumcised according to the law. Today's Gospel lesson opens with Joseph and Mary being compelled by the laws God handed down through Moses. They came to the temple to present their firstborn son to Lord and for ritual purification after childbirth. They offer a sacrifice so that Mary may be readmitted to the temple for worship. They offered two pigeons or two turtledove in lieu of a lamb they could not afford. This is all in accordance with the law listed in [Leviticus 12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=leviticus+12&version=NRSV). The priest would have made atonement for Mary and declared her ritually cleansed. She was then allowed to return to worship.

Luke tells of a man named Simeon who lived in Jerusalem. He describes him as righteous, devout, and looking forward to Jerusalem receiving the Messiah. The Holy Spirit rested upon him. The Spirit had, in fact, told Simeon that he would not die until he met the Messiah. When Christ was born, the Spirit led Simeon to Mary and Joseph in the temple.

When Mary allowed Simeon to hold her baby, he praises God saying,

> <sup>29</sup> “Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace,
>    according to your word;
> <sup>30</sup> for my eyes have seen your salvation,
> <sup>31</sup>     which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,
> <sup>32</sup> a light for revelation to the Gentiles
>     and for glory to your people Israel.”

Simeon holds God's salvation in his arms. He holds God in his arms. This baby is the God of both Jews and Gentiles. 

Mary and Joseph, naturally, are bewildered about all the excitement over Mary's baby. Simeon blesses their family and tells Mary that this child is going to through Israel into upheavel and will make many enemies who reveal their true motivations through their opposition to Christ. He tells her that a sword will pierce her own soul.

Mary and Joseph met another prophet named Anna. She had been married once, but was widowed after only seven years. She had not left the temple since her husband's death. She was there day and night, fasting and praying. When Anna saw the baby Jesus, she immediately began praising God and telling all those looking looking for Jerrusalem to be set free from her oppressors.

In all this, Joseph and Mary fulfilled their obligation to the Law and returned to Nazereth, where Jesus grew up as all children do. He was filled with wisdom and enjoyed the favour of his Father.


## Psalm 111

## Colossians 3:12-17

Paul declares the Colossian church to be _God's chosen ones_. They are beloved. They are set apart as holy. As such, they should seek to be characterized by compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience. If you have a complaint against someone, forgive as God has forgiven you. This is a must. You don't really have any other choice. Above all, be characterized by love. Love binds everything together. Let Christ's peace rule in your hearts and in your church and be thankful. Let Christ's Word live in you and grow. Teach and correct with wisdom, and worship God while giving thanks. Do and say everything in Christ's name, giving thanks to the Father through the Son.
