# Be Generous because God is generous with you

## Exodus 13:1-3a, 11-15

The Israelite's, led by Moses, have just left Egypt amidst nation-wide tragedy. The lives of every firstborn animal and every firstborn Egyptian had been taken by God in the night. It was this event that finally coerced Pharoah into allowing the Israelite slaves to worship God in the desert without their Egyptian overseers. Having discovered their children dead in the middle of the night, both Pharoah and the Egyptian people urged the Israelite's to leave immediately. Under Moses' instructions, they had prepared for this event by eating a feast, packing their bags, and preparing food for the journey. The Israelite slaves didn't know when they'd be allowed to leave, but they knew they'd better be prepared. Their bread was made without yeast because there would be no time for the dough to rise. God further supplied their exodus by granting them favour in the eyes of their Egyptian neighbours. When asked by the Israelites, they were generous in giving jewelry, gold, silver, and clothing in order to hasten their departure. Apart from God's favour, the Egyptians feared more of their people would die if the Israelites lingered any longer.

This event became known as the _Passover_, because God had _passed over_ all the firstborn of Israel.

Today's Old Testament lesson opens with God instructing Moses in light of the Passover. He tells him that the firstborn of every animal and every Israelite belongs to Him. They are to be consecrated, or set apart as per God's command.

Moses, relays God's instruction to Israel. They are to remember the day God set them free from slavery in Egypt. They are to remember how they prepared to leave the moment the opportunity arose. This occasion is set apart to give glory to God and to celebrate his immeasurable strength. Moses tells Israel to mark the occasion with a week-long festival called the Festival of Unleavend Bread. Passover is only one day. The festival that follows is seven days. Leaven, that is yeast, isn't even allowed in the house during this time of worship, celebration, and remembrance. 

Though the Israelites had left Egypt, they had not yet entered the land God promised to them. All this happens before Moses parts the Red Sea while being pursued by Pharoah. Moses tells the Israelites that when God gives them the promised land of Canaan, they are to set aside their firstborn males. Not only the firstborn of their livestock, but their firstborn sons as well. These animals and people belong to God. The animals are to be sacrificed, with one exception... donkeys may be purchased back from God by sacrificing a sheep instead. If you do not redeem the donkey, you must break its neck. Firstborn baby boys must be redeemed. They are allowed no other option.

Moses tells the Israelites how to instruct their children when they ask us why the firstborn are set apart in this way. They are to tell their children that they were once slaves in Egypt. They left Egypt by God's strength. Because of Pharoah's stubborness, God killed all the firstborn animals and Egyptians. In remembrance of this, the Israelites sacrifice all the firstborn of their flocks. In remembrance of this, they purchase freedom for their firstborn sons.

The Israelites are to celebrate this event and tell the story to their children. God freed Israel from Egypt. Their very existence is a sign of God's strength.

### Reflection

Seeing as how I'm a [Wycliffe Bible Translator](https://wycliffe.ca), I don't suspect that anyone would be surprised that I read the Bible every day. This year I completed my eleventh pass from Genesis to Revelation. Starting January 1st, I read four chapters every day. At this rate, in a regular non-leap year, I finish on October 24th. From there, I do a second pass of the New Testament. I finish on December 28th, which gives me a few days to choose a translation to start reading on New Year's Day. No matter how many times I read it, the story of Israel is frustrating. As an outsider looking in, it's astounding how quickly the Israelites forget all that they have seen. These are God's own chosen people, and they routinely break their side of the covenant God made with them. Several times they even look back to the security they knew in slavery rather than trusting God to provide for their needs.

In today's Old Testament lesson, we find the Israelites at a defining moment in their history as a sovereign nation. Having just celebrated the first Passover, God instructs them to start planning a party: the Festival of Unleavened Bread. All this so that Israel remembers what happened. All this so that they can teach their children what God did for Israel. God commands Israel to celebrate this way every year. He then reminds the people of his promise of a homeland and delivers some day-to-day instruction for when they get there. He says the firstborn of all people and animals belong to him. This is to constantly remind Israel of the awesome power unleashed by God during the first Passover. 

The themes of freedom, truth, celebration, promise, and the fear of God flow through this lesson.

## Psalm 111

Likewise, we see these themes in our other Old Testament lesson, Psalm 111. All these themes are captured in the final two verses:

> He sent redemption to his people;
>    he has commanded his covenant forever.
>    Holy and awesome is his name.

> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom;
>    all those who practice it have a good understanding.
>    His praise endures forever.

God redeemed his people. Israel owes their freedom to Him. Know this and know _The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom_. Obey God and live by the covenant he made. Seek His will in all matters and be wise. Know that what God says is true. Worship Him. 


### Reflection



## Luke 2:22-40

The Passover was an extraordinarily public event. Christ's birth also took place in the public eye so that witnesses would remember God's promises. From the opening of the chapter, Luke tells of Joseph and Mary being compelled by the government of the time to be counted in a census. And he tells of shepherds being visited by angels who announce the child's birth.

The angels say,

> “Glory to God in the highest heaven,
>    and on earth peace among those whom he favors!”
> [Luke 2:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+2%3A14&version=NRSV)

Upon hearing this, they rush into Bethlehem to see the child for themselves.

After 8 days, the child is named Jesus and circumcised in accordance with the Law. Today's Gospel lesson opens with Joseph and Mary being compelled by the laws God handed down through Moses. They came to the temple to redeem Mary's firstborn son and for Mary's own ritual purification after childbirth. They offer a sacrifice so that she may be readmitted to the temple for worship. They offered two pigeons or two turtledove in lieu of a lamb they could not afford. This is all in accordance with the law listed in [Leviticus 12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=leviticus+12&version=NRSV). The priest would have made atonement for Mary and declared her ritually cleansed. She was then allowed to return to worship.

Luke tells of a man named Simeon who lived in Jerusalem. He describes him as righteous, devout, and looking forward to Jerusalem receiving the Messiah. The Holy Spirit rested upon him. The Spirit had, in fact, told Simeon that he would not die until he met the Messiah. When Christ was born, the Spirit led Simeon to Mary and Joseph in the temple.

When Mary allowed Simeon to hold her baby, he praises God saying,

> <sup>29</sup> “Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace,
>    according to your word;
> <sup>30</sup> for my eyes have seen your salvation,
> <sup>31</sup>     which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,
> <sup>32</sup> a light for revelation to the Gentiles
>     and for glory to your people Israel.”

Simeon holds God's salvation in his arms. He holds God in his arms. This baby is the God of both Jews and Gentiles. 

Mary and Joseph, naturally, are bewildered about all the excitement over Jesus. Simeon blesses their family and tells Mary that this child is going to throw Israel into upheavel and will make many enemies who reveal their true motivations through their opposition to him. He tells her that a sword will pierce her own soul.

Mary and Joseph meet another prophet named Anna. She had been married once, but was widowed after only seven years. Luke tells us that she had not left the temple since her husband's death. Day and night, she fasted and prayed. When Anna saw the baby Jesus, she immediately began praising God. From there, she began telling faithful Jews about the child. These Jews were looking forward to, and fully expecting Jerusalem's redemption from her oppressors.

In all this, Joseph and Mary fulfilled their obligation to the Law and returned to Nazereth, where Jesus grew up as all children do. He was filled with wisdom and enjoyed the favour of his Father.

### Reflection

Jesus is just a baby in Luke 2. His ministry will not begin for another three decades. But even at the start of the story, we catch a glimpse of how it will end. Simeon knows the current world order is about to be shaken to its foundations. The prophet Anna knows God will make good on his promise of freedom for the the Jews through this child. Amidst all the joy and worship, we know that Mary will not escape unscathed. Something will happen that will injure her very soul.

It's only Christmas, and already we're looking forward to Easter where the child redeemed by Mary and Joseph is sacrificed for the redemption of all people. Simeon and Anna obeyed God and were wise. Even then they probably had no idea of the freedom God has in mind. They knew Mary would grieve, but probably had no idea of the price God would pay to purchase our freedom.

Like the Passover, Christ's birth is a defining moment for our people. We celebrate it every year, and when our children ask what it means, we tell them that the Word became flesh. That to all who believe in Jesus, he gives power to become children of God, who were born, not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man, but of God. We celebrate and give all glory to God and this unparalleled show of power. We look forward to Easter when we discover once and for all that God's promised redemption from death and sin is true.

## Colossians 3:12-17

Finally, in our epistle lesson, Paul declares the Colossian church to be _God's chosen ones_. They are beloved. They are set apart as holy. As such, they must seek to be characterized by compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience. If you have a complaint against someone, forgive as God has forgiven you. This is a must. You don't really have any other choice. Above all, be characterized by love. Love binds everything together. Let Christ's peace rule in your hearts and in your church and be thankful. Let Christ's Word live in you and grow. Teach and correct with wisdom, and worship God while giving thanks. Do and say everything in Christ's name, giving thanks to the Father through the Son.

### Reflection

Like Moses and the Israelites, Paul gives instruction on how to worship God. With Christ's death and resurrection still close in history, we are to forgive others as God has forgive us. God paid for freedom from death and sin on the cross. It is a price too high for anyone apart from God. In light of this, you ahve no other option. We are witnesses to the truth, set free from death as promised by God. Let us celebrate, sing praise, and enjoy the peace we know by being aligned with God's will and united to one another through love.


## Conclusion

Throughout these lessons, and indeed the entire Bible, we are constantly reminded of God's sovereign power. We are reminded that whatever God says is true. If God makes a promise, the promise itself is truth. This truth is embodied in the birth, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Times of celebration like Christmas and Passover are meant to be times of joy certainly, but also reminder of God's power and love. The act of offering Himself to purchase our freedom from. and why obedience is in our own best interests. 


The themes of freedom, truth, celebration, promise, and the fear of God flow through this lesson.
