## What's Wycliffe?

When my supervisor first joined Wycliffe many years ago, she said they used to call us "Canada's best kept secret". I asked one potential supporter what he knew about Wycliffe and he said he thought we were a "print shop"... that we print paper Bibles. Like Gideons, perhaps.

That person didn't know that Wycliffe:

- Creates new alphabets for languages that cannot be written down
- Provides physical and on-screen keyboards for minority languages, the basic tools of literacy
- Teaches people to read

And with literacy comes education, equality, and economy.

Since November, in raising support for my call to Wycliffe, I've arranged 102 fund-raising appointments. These were with individuals and couples who were all interested in joining me in Bible translation work. Most of these people had a general sense of the stated purpose of the organization. Wycliffe brings Scripture to people who have none. We alleviate Bible poverty. Some of the people with whom I met already knew that there are over 7,000 languages spoken on earth today. 2,000 haven't a single verse of Scripture. Many of those are the languages that can't yet be written down.

You may know all these things about Wycliffe too. We transform lives with God's Word. We change lives in physical, material ways as well. From education, equality, and economy we add a story told in eternity. Wycliffe is a world-wide organization, and I am just one more servant with the privilege of being called to build God's Kingdom and to change this world.

My mission with Wycliffe will be carried out here at home. I was born and raised in Calgary, Alberta. I am at least two generations removed from any serious church tradition. My family didn't even attend church at Christmas and Easter. It was God's Word that transformed my life on July 28, 2003 when I said _Jesus, you can do with me whatever you want from now on. My life is in your hands_. Two years later I found myself at Ambrose Seminary. I hold a Master of Divinity and a Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of Calgary. My graduate research involved Artificial Intelligence with an eye toward organizational automation. I have a wife and four children and have been teaching Web Development for the last four years in addition to many entrepreneurial pursuits and serving in our church, Saint Peter's Lutheran in Cochrane. God has vastly multiplied his blessings upon me by calling me to serve with Wycliffe. It's all more significant that I am living proof of the power of God's Word.

When I left university, I was immediately employed as a Web Developer. Computers execute software written my computer programmers. A Web Developer is a computer programmer who writes software for delivery over the World Wide Web. As you can imagine, software plays a huge part in Wycliffe's world-wide translation effort. I had the privilege of flying to Dallas, Texas to attend a work convention in February. I hadn't been surrounded by so many _actual_ Computer Scientists since my university days. It was fascinating to talk to these men and women because of their many years practicing their discipline. Wycliffe is a high-tech organization. Though I'm not the youngest member, at fourty years old, I'm still very much the _new kid_. Wycliffe is an _old_ organization and is still Canada's best kept secret. At one fundraising meeting, I shared Wycliffe's work with a potential young supporter. He said, "I always thought of Wycliffe as my _grandma's_ organization".

To me, everything I've described is incredibly exciting. Even apart from carrying out Christ's Great Commission, those who participate in Wycliffe's work are literally writing history. We don't boast enough about this. Certainly we would not boast to be prideful, but to get people excited about how God's Word changes the world in ways that are worth celebrating. I boast in that in the name of Jesus here today, and I'm excited to be able to extend the invitation to join in this work to you.

As a computer programmer, I am naturally excited about software and machines. Programmers are writers, and writing is my preferred mode of self expression. But software is not what excites me about Wycliffe. I am excited about Wycliffe because of the opportunities it brings. Wycliffe brings opportunities for anyone looking to serve God in some way. This service may come in the form of financially partnering with a missionary like me, or maybe you are called to serve. That's how I came to Wycliffe, at the invitation of a missionary speaking at my church just like I'm doing here today. Wycliffe is actively recruiting. We need people much younger than me to join in this work. May God raise up young missionaries from within this church and within the CALC denomination. May God raise up young supporters too. Remember how Wycliffe was described as _grandma's organization_? Most of my partners are retired. Eventually the work will not be able to continue unless young families carry on their grandparent's legacy of generosity.

Once my missionary budget is proven sustainable, I'm slated to join work on a translation tool called ScriptureForge. This is a web application and I am a web developer. They want my help and there is a job waiting for me right now. The reality is, however, I may never contribute to that project. Remember how I've asked 102 people so far? As a result of those meetings, I have filled 12% of my budget. At this rate, I will need to talk to 900 more people to get up to full support. Finding 102 was incredibly time consuming. We were expecting to have fulfilled my budget by this past February. Ever since my first day, Wycliffe has coached and prepared me to ask people to invest in my work. I am closely scrutinized, which is scrutiny I welcome, because it means I've been held accountable for my efforts. So with everyone but God at a loss as to what to do about my low support level, four weeks ago, my coach said, _How do we let go and let God?_ Clearly, launching my mission is going to take a miracle. 

That last meeting with _one of_ my coaches came at the right time, because I had already recognized an exciting opportunity within the Wycliffe organization itself. I suspect most of us have had to contend with company bureaucracy. If you've worked for or been apart of an organization of reasonable size, paperwork is likely a regular irritation. It is often needlessly complicated and takes time away from doing your _real job_. In general, these processes first established to make things easier seem to get more complex over time. Wycliffe is the largest organization of which I've been a part, and it's been around for almost 80 years. As you can image, there are many opportunities for our administrative processes to be simplified.

In _letting go and letting God_, I took a step back from actively pursuing new support contacts and took a look at one of Wycliffe's paperwork problems. This is one that is a problem for me personally. Like when running a business, certain expenses can be deducted and claimed against your taxes. I don't have _business_ expenses, but I do have _ministry_ expenses. These work the same way. Currently, in order to claim a ministry expense I need to fill out an Excel spreadsheet. This is already problematic because I don't own Microsoft Excel. Using an open source spreadsheet option, I fill in a bunch of rows and columns with the receipt totals, items purchased, and the justification for the expense. I am then required to scan every paper receipt and apply a filename in a very particular format. Other receipt documents like PDFs and emails must also be saved in a similar fashion. These invoices must then be crossreferenced with the line items on the form. Once all the paperwork is bundled in a Zip file, I email a copy to both my supervisor and the Finance team. Each side looks at the expenses and either approves or asks for corrections. Once approved, both my supervisor and the ministry expense clerk print a paper copy and have me sign twice. Thankfully, I am no longer expected to submit the paper receipts themselves, though now I have to keep them in my filing cabinet for a whole year.

This process can definitely be simplified... and it already has been...

Currently, the work generated by the expense claim process hardly makes it worth the time and effort. You may have experienced something like this firsthand in your own careers. Paperwork is a real problem. Computer programmers solve problems with machines. The opportunity God has laid before me is rooted in the fact that Wycliffe currently pays people money to do the work of machines. There is support to be raised by reducing operating costs and claiming part of the savings for my mission.

Most at Wycliffe recognize the mutual opportunity I bring to the table, though even this one small improvement is meeting with resistance. The project I have undertaken has been affirmed by my various supervisors and coaches and is in beta production right now. I have a handful of guinea pigs providing feedback on this web application. As a professional test-driven web developer, I am able to be responsive in producing an application that is easy to use and simplifies an existing administrative process. Wycliffe members gather every Wednesday for a time of worship and prayer. Sky-rocketing administrative costs appear regularly in our prayer requests. For Wycliffe, the skills I bring to the organization are an answer to actual prayers. 

This is the opportunity currently presented to me and Wycliffe. I am looking to raise temporary support by reducing operating costs. My expensing application is only one of many opportunities. It was written and deployed in four weeks (though work is ongoing). Though this is an exciting support-raising opportunity, this money will eventually dry up. Looking toward the future, I still need financial partners to enable me to support the world-wide translation effort. I like cutting costs, but ultimately my skills are best applied in enabling Wycliffe translators to do more translation work, more efficiently. It is for this efficiency that I program machines to perform certain tasks.

God has called me to service with Wycliffe, so this is going to happen eventually. In anticipation, God has given me the shadow of any idea on how to get every language into translation. He has given me a thought on how to quickly update old translations (especially in the Middle East) with modern language. Translation work will likely end when Christ returns. We're all waiting on that. While we're waiting, He told us to go tell everybody about His sacrfice on the cross and the Good News of what this means for those who believe God's Word. We are a long way from completing our God-given assignment. In the meantime, it's just so good to spread God's Word and witness how lives and entire civilizations are transformed. Nothing gets me more excited.

 Ask God. This may be an opportunity for you. An opportunity to carry on the legacy of generosity shown by your grandparents. I'm boasting about Wycliffe being _grandma's organization_. Your grandparents built it. You can invest in an already dynamic, impactful organization. Your generosity enables us to do more translation work cheaper, more efficiently. That's exciting. We don't brag enough at Wycliffe. We don't brag about how when you partner with us, you know exactly where your money is going and you know exactly the impact it's having. The Red Cross can't brag like that. World Vision can't brag like that. I wonder what their administrative costs are.

### Praise:

- For the opportunity to be here today!
- For the opportunities and excitement that comes with serving God

### Prayer requests:

- We need financially responsible, young supporters
- That the walls around Wycliffe's administration would continue to crack 
- More Christian programmers

Wycliffe brings all sorts of opportunities. It has offered me the opportunity to show leadership in preparing an almost 80 year old organization for translation work in the 22nd Century. This is a great privilege and well worth your investment. Likewise, thank you Pastor Jim who allowed me to be here today. I took this as an opportunity to show leadership in building the CALC denomination. May God continue to raise up missionaries from within our congregations. May he show us how to support and enable those who come after me.

### Peace be with you,

## Dan
