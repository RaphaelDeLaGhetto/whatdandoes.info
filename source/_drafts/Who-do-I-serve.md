My name is Daniel Bidulock. According to the _specifics_ of my job description, I am a Language Software Developer for an NGO call [SIL International](https://sil.org). In broader terms, most people know me as a [Wycliffe Bible Translator](https://wycliffe.ca).

Lots of people know Wycliffe. Fewer know SIL. Founded 1934, our purpose is to study, develop, and document languages. Of over 7000 living languages spoken on earth today, [as many as 3000](https://www.ethnologue.com/enterprise-faq/how-many-languages-world-are-unwritten-0) cannot be written down.  When a civilization comes to the point where they want to be able to record their own stories, SIL International is there to serve that need.

In the simplest terms, language development is _literacy_. We know the consequences of _illiteracy_ to be disasterous. This is true on both the individual level, and at the level of society. SIL International provides the fundamental tools of basic literacy to people who would otherwise be marginalized and forgotten.

Some of what we create includes:

- New alphabets for the languages that cannot be written down
- Physical and on-screen computer keyboards to write with these new alphabets
- Literacy apps to teach people how to read and write

SIL International serves civilizations who want to be lifted up. Together, in partnership with these people, we literally write history. More importantly, we bring God's Word so they can be lifted up. So they know to look to the cross and see that Jesus loves them.

SIL International also serves Bible translators all around the world. Of some you may have heard, like the Lutheran Bible Translators, the Jesus Film Project, and of course the Wycliffe Global Alliance. There are many more. We create the software tools used by Bible translation agencies. Together we serve God by carrying out Christ's Great Commission. 

I serve through SIL International. I am a computer programmer who writes software for the World Wide Web. I hold a Master of Divinity from Ambrose Seminary and a Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of Calgary. God prepared me and called me to serve. Until I'm called elsewhere, there is no better use of my time apart from Bible translation. Unless I'm called elsewhere, I'll be doing Bible translation until I die. As a living testimony to the power of God's Word, I am privileged to be allowed to serve this way.

I did not grow up in a Christian home. We did not go to church. My parents didn't really go to church either. Their families were _Christmas and Easter church-goers_, at best. Despite this, God put in me a desire to know the truth. With a sincere heart and mind for this knowledge, I reached out and God gave me his Word on comic book Bible tracts I found at the bus stop. Though foreign and hilariously offensive to my pagan sensibilities, I soon saw that God's Word is written all around us. I heard His voice in everything, including movies, music, and television. I gave my life to Jesus on July 28, 2003 because of comic books.

Seventeen years later, I read four Bible chapters every day. Starting in January, I finish the entire Bible by October 24th. This gives me enough time to do a second pass of the New Testament. I finish this on December 27th. This year, I am on my thirteenth front-to-back reading of the Bible and have completely lost track of the English translations I've covered. My first and favourite is the New Living Translation. Of those on my bookshelf, I've read the New International Version, the New American Standard Bible, the New Catholic Edition, the New Revised Standard Version, the Hebrew-English Holy Scriptures, and the Old and New King James version. I'm currently reading the Amplified version on [biblegateway.com](https://www.biblegateway.com/). I have not read the Bible on paper for at least seven years.

For those of use who learned English first, we are blessed with a rich legacy of Bible translations (more than 450 according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_translations_into_English). God's Word is written all around us. If we want to know the truth, we can reach out any time and take hold of it. You read the Bible and see through all the lies. Though I am uniquely qualified to serve God through SIL and Wycliffe, I serve primarily as a living testimony to the power of God's Word.

Witnessing to Christ, I serve my neighbours who can reach out, take hold of God's Word, and meet Jesus any time they want. As a Bible translator I serve those who cannot do the same. People for whom no Bible exists. After centuries of work, we have 450 English Bibles. There are over 2000 languages for which not even a single verse has been translated. No finding comic book Bible tracts at the bus stop for these people. I serve these people as a living testimony to the power of God's Word.

But to even get to the point where we are learning to record a language on paper, we have decades or even centuries of missions work. People who have devoted their lives to sharing Christ's Good News. It takes time and dedication to raise up Christian in places where there are none. It takes time and dedication to build a community who has heard God's Word, and sees the importance of being able to write it down. It takes time and dedication to raise up people within this community who want to raise up their culture, translate the Bible, and write their stories in eternity.

It's at this point where Bible translators step in. I serve translators from all agencies, all over the world. They use SIL software to do carry out their missions. They build up communities with God's Word and with literacy. The consequences of illiteracy - inequality, poverty, ignorance, dependency, frustration, crime, violence - all these give way to equality, economy, and education. Life is better where there are Christians. People are set free to build up their homes and communities. But none of this matters when measured against what is offered by the Bible itself. To education, equality, and economy we add _eternity_. Let all those with ears to hear listen: look to the cross. Jesus loves you.

Before computers - even before basic word processing - a translation project could easily take 40 years. Now, a Bible translation project takes as little as ten. We serve the missionary translators by providing the tools that allow them to do more work, more efficiently. Wycliffe's goal is to have a Bible in the process of translation for every language by 2025.

That goal was set twenty years ago. For those who prayerfully considered this pledge, I'm sure it seemed like a long time off. We have five years left... though we can accomplish nothing apart from God, we do have the technology to achieve this. 

I serve SIL software developers.






Of all the people





 God, I pray my neighbours reach out, and I pray they receive your Word. They can do this, whenever they want. God's Word is written all around us.




 Sometimes when I walk through my neighbourhood I can feel the despair and hopelessness in the homes I pass. Neighbours all around, packed in rows so close, yet isolated. Loneliness, pointlessness, hurt, and disgust. I don't know my neighbours, but I know each and every one of them needs Jesus. I reached out and God gave me his Word on comic book Bible tracts I found at the bus stop. God, I pray my neighbours reach out, and I pray they receive your Word. They can do this, whenever they want. God's Word is written all around us.

Hundreds of millions of people are reaching out to God, but there are no words they understand. There is no Bible to tell them the story in they language they speak in their head and heart. At best, they may find Christianity expressed in the words of the people who conquered them. From this, only God's Word, Jesus Christ, can set them free. Only God's Word can lift up people and civilizations.

I serve these people, our neighbours, those around me and those around the world, by writing software for the World Wide Web. I read four Bible chapters every day. Starting in January, I finish the entire Bible by October 24th. This gives me enough time to do a second pass of the New Testament. I finish December 27th. This year, I am on my thirteenth full-pass of the Bible. I have completely lost track of the English translations I've covered. My first and favourite is the New Living Translation. I'm currently reading the Amplified version. For those of use who learned English first, we are blessed with a rich legacy of Bible translations (more than 450 according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_translations_into_English).







In Canada, we know what happens when people are pushed aside like this. Look to the aboriginal communities around us. We call them _First Nations_, because at one time, they were independent, sovereign people. In the interests of peace, North America's aboriginal people signed treaties they couldn't read with names they couldn't write. One one side of these contracts you can read the names of those representating the British Crown. On the other side, you see _X_s or hand-drawn pictures of animals representing tribal leaders. To make matters worse, [the oral tradition maintained by tribal elders often doesn't match what is actually recorded on paper in the treaties](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/treaties-from-1760-1923-two-sides-to-the-story-1.1081839). Tribal leaders were told the document said something that it didn't. First Nations tell the stories of what happened, but they didn't write it down. 

Two to three hundred years later we are still living with consequence of pre-literate, indigenous societies being steam-rolled by a colonial superpower. The consequences of illiteracy are disasterous.
