# Partnership Development:

## Who am I?

My name is Daniel Bidulock. I was born in Calgary and raised in what I call the _nostril of Nose Hill_... 14th Street NW. You can see the road that takes me to my childhood home through the window. I grew up in a non-Christian home with my mom, dad, and younger brother. We didn't go to church, even on Christmas and Easter.

As a child, I had every advantage. I lived in a loving, stable home. We went to school, played hockey, travelled... my mom built a long-standing career in seismic processing for oil exploration. My dad taught Computer Science at the University of Calgary. Growing up I spent a lot of time on campus. It's changed a lot, but the UofC still feels like home.

Though I know the exact date when I gave my life to Jesus, the origins of my Christian journey are hazy. The details will be revealed in eternity I'm sure. Looking back, the most obvious starting point was during my later years of my first tour through university. In the year 2000, my brother and I bought a house in Capitol Hill, which is a post-war neighbourhood near SAIT. In traveling back and forth to school, work, and the various places I went with my friends, I started picking up comic book Bible tracts I found at the bus stops in my neighbourhood.

The story of a non-believer counting on a merciful God to recognize that he's _basically good person_ is a common theme in these comics. Sometimes they're about shameless unrepentant sinners scoffing at the idea of God. The stories usually end with that person only discovering the truth upon waking up in hell. As a non-Christian, the tracts were hilariously offensive. I collected every one I saw and have many duplicates. I read them all from front to back, always finding a verse of Scripture at the end. The core message, as offensive as it was, carried over into my life. I began to see the basic true and false in everything. This was especially true of movies, music, and television. God's basic truth is self-evident in creation and everything we create, whether intended or not.

There is more to my story than can be shared here. A decade into my Christian life, God began revealing the people who had been praying for me. This included a good high school friend. I sobbed like a baby when he shared this with me. First through prayer, and the having received the truth through God's Word, I gave my life to Jesus on July 28, 2003 parked outside the Tim Hortons across from SAIT.

In a moment I came up from a foggy valley and found myself perched on top of a high mountain, seeing clearly in all directions for the first time. I'm certainly not alone in describing the experience this way.

Two years later I was attending Faith Lutheran Church here in Calgary. This was my first _home_ church. One February Sunday my pastor issued a liturgical call to the congregation for parish ministers. I was sitting in the back when I felt a finger flick my ear hard. I turned around. No one was there. I remember the moment. From there, God's call grew louder day by day. That same September I found myself enrolled in the Canadian Theological Seminary, now known as Ambrose. In the three years of my studies I was employed as the Youth Director at Faith Lutheran, interned at Southside Victory, served two terms on Seminary Student Council, completed advanced courses in ancient Hebrew and Greek, appeared on a reality dating show, and most importantly met the woman who would become my wife. Lyndsay holds a Masters of Leadership and Ministry degree from Ambrose.

We married the summer after graduation with the goal of planting an Alliance church in downtown Calgary. My good friend from seminary and I were given the greenlight on the project. We were very good friends. I was Best Man at his wedding. That project fell apart spectacularly in the space of weeks. We didn't speak for nine years. All is forgiven, but we will never be friends again.

From there I was accepted back at the UofC to pursue graduate research in Artificial Intelligence. My research laid the groundwork for making people and software interchangable. This is not the fun self-driving car AI, my work was motivated by a desire for organizational automation. During my second round of grad school I was allowed the opportunity to present on Evolution vs Intelligent Design in a Biological Computation course. I got my first taste of Natural Language Processing in a Computation Linguistics course. It was there that I independently created a predictive text program, much like the ones you enjoy on your cell phones. This first appeared commercially six months after my instructor gave me my only A+ ever in the course. I also served as Vice President Academic and then Acting President of the Graduate Students Association. Most importantly, my first child, Eva, was born.

After graduating and kicking around oil and gas for year, I landed a job with an human resources software company. I was awarded a provincial grant to carry out industrial research into what was called Semantic Search. My main contribution was process by which candidate resumes were automatically sorted in order of most qualified to least. The process is basically the same as how a human HR manager does it, but takes seconds instead of hours potentially. This kind of software is common place in large organizations today. It seems impressive, but in terms of potential, things like ranking and predictive text are low-hanging fruit. When I left that job, I asked God that it would be my last. He answered that prayer and I have been self-employed ever since. Most importantly, I had three more children in that time... Malachi, Stella, and Lydia. That was about five years ago.

I asked God, _what do I do now?_ He said, _do whatever you like_. So I did. I love making stuff. Salvaged wooden trays, stickers, t-shirts, some of the jewelry you see on my wife is handmade by me. The income generated by these endeavours coupled with a contract consultant position with a company called Lighthouse Labs has sustained my family. Lighthouse trains junior Web Developers. We have 96% employer placement rate. Though I'm only a contractor, they call me the _Lead Mentor_ in Calgary. They also have permanent classes in Vancouver and Toronto. Teaching and mentoring at Lighthouse has made me a better Web Developer.

In addition to building new products, I also love serving my church and community. I teach Sunday School, initiated our Syrian Refugee fundraiser, assisted worship at the Bethany Care Centre in Cochrane, I preside and preach when called, and am currently organizing the first ever Lutheran Missions Fest, at which I'll be exhibiting. If you'd like to do some PD, just ask and we'll allot you some space. In terms of the wider community, I've maintained a site called TaxReformYYC.com for five years, ever since they overassessed my house when I first bought it. This is a frustrating and lonely cause.

In all this, I got pretty efficient at spinning up small businesses. For many years, God would give me an idea, I would build it, and then see if I could find customers. This all changed two years ago when a guest speaker at Lighthouse said, _Dan, don't write another line of code until you have customer and money in the bank_. This was the best business advice I ever received. Much like my conversion experience, I could see clearly for the first time... I'd been doing it backwards my whole life. Find a customer, build the relationship, and humbly ask, _how can I help?_

The first time I put this into practice was when I created TheMiningKing.com. The _mining_, in this case, pertains to crypto currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. I was contracted by a local dentist to build an Ethereum mining rig as an investment. It was here where I turned my attention to the crypto-version of eCommerce. Buying and selling on the Web and Darkweb with crypto currency. Primitive, though it may be, I believe this is the world's first open source crypto storefront software. You can learn how to setup your own store at TheMiningKing.com.

Then, just over one year ago, Derrell Friesen spoke at my church, Saint Peter's Lutheran in Cochrane. We got to talking, one thing led to another, and here I am. My focus has shifted from money and machines to people... and money. I have not yet found a word that captures the privilege, hard work, frustration, and joy involved in cultivating financial partnerships. Best of all, though I'm called, I still get to do what I want to do. Better yet, I still don't really have a _job_. God answered my prayer beyond anything I could expect. Becoming a member of Wycliffe is easily the coolest thing I've ever done, and I am grateful to be here.

I was accepted as a member in May last year. I immediately set myself to reading the canon of Wycliffe fundraising literature, doing Bible studies, and preparing and honing my message. Several large donations arrived in the later part of last year. This allowed me to help prepare my replacement at Lighthouse Labs, so that I would be free to do PD full time. 

Who are my supporters.

It's easy to see in retrospect how God prepared me in advance to serve in this way. I have been faithfully applying what I know and learning new things on the fly. In preparation for today I made a list of these new things I've learned. This list continues to grow, but these seem most important:
