Preaching is Bible translation. Retelling stories in a way that speaks to the heart. Proclaiming the truth of your salvation in Christ.

It's not easy to understand. Sometimes the heart and mind are hard, infertile ground. For those whose hearts and minds provide rich soil, Sunday's sermons become a reminder that our sins are forgiven and that our lives in eternity belong to God.

This is the story of creation as told by a Computer Scientist.

# Genesis 1:1-4

> <sup>1</sup> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.<sup>2</sup> The earth was formless and empty, and darkness covered the deep waters. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters.
>
> <sup>3</sup> Then God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. <sup>4</sup> And God saw that the light was good. Then he separated the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light “day” and the darkness “night.”
>
> And evening passed and morning came, marking the first day.


Few people appreciate the philosophical foundations of Computer Science. I only understand it as mode of self expression. Computer programming allows me to create with a machine. I speak the language of machines, which ultimately, if done well, is communicated to you, the _user_.

Few people understand how Computer Science is even _science_. We are unique in that the scientific method is embodied entirely in the computer program, written in the language of machines. Hypothesis, observation, and proof are all wrapped up in the program. The _science_ of computer science is demonstrated when we prove a problem can be solved by a machine... the problem is _computable_.

For most people, the apps on our phones and laptops are where it begins and ends. When you start asking the question of which problems are computable, new questions about reality, randomness, probability, and life. You may conclude that what is impossible for a machine, is also impossible in the world in which we live and breath.

This is an incredible revelation. It is a new way to express God's truth. It reveals God, and reveals His image in us. We create with our words. We create like God.

But it's even more incredible than that...

When I write a program, I write it so that people can understand it. Computers don't use words like we do. The words I write in a program are translated into electrical charges stored on disk. If there is a high voltage on one tiny transistor we symbolize it with a 1. If there is a low voltage, we symbolize it with a 0. Human language gets interpreted into 1s and 0s, and then ultimately into electrical magnetic charges on billions of transistors on a silicon chip. Digital electronics. The 1s and 0s are the digits we chose. I write the program and the machine does what I tell it to do.

Can I solve a problem in this way? When it comes to Bible translation, the answer is definitely _yes_. God gave me the gifts to observe, hypothesis, and prove.


Think of what can be expressed with 1s and 0s.

Every story ever told or will ever be told. Why not? Who hasn't read stories on a computer?

Where do we see evidence of God's creative hands in all this? We see it in ourselves. We also see it in infinity. A secular Computer Scientist knows that nothing is random and that nothing in this universe is infinite. A Christian knows that God is infinite.

Apart from God, when I think infinite, my mind drifts to the number Pi. When you try to calculate it, you find that it goes on forever. Even more curious, there's no discernable pattern in the sequence of numbers that depict Pi. We use computers to calculate Pi to trillions of decimal points. No repetition yet.

Pi, of course, when calculated by a computer is first expressed in 1s and 0s. Just like a computer program. Just like your favourite novel.

Pi, remember, is infinite. Somewhere in Pi, there is a sequence of 1s and 0s, that if given to a computer, will execute a program. Not only that, every variant of that program is also encodes somewhere in the digits that form Pi. It could a simple program that says _Hello, world!_, or it might be Super Mario. It's all there somewhere in the _chaos_ of Pi, but we need to translate it. We need to speak order into the chaos. No one's done this yet, as I'm aware. Probably because this is how God creates. He spoke and imposed his order on the chaos.

This is the story of creation as told by a Computer Scientist. Let the story speak to your heart and mind. May God guide your hand in expressing your creativity to write a good story. Some have sad stories, but Christ the Word, our Author, our Creator, our Programmer, makes sad story good.

I boast in Jesus when I boast about how Wycliffe is literally writing history. I need you to help write this story. You are writing your own story into eternity.
