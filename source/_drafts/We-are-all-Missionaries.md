# Lutheran Missions Fest, 2019

It's a great privilege to have been a part of organizing this first Lutheran Missions Fest. Mission work is work that should be celebrated. Though Lutheranism is my adopted tradition, I also think Lutheran culture is something worth celebrating as well. We hope to make this festival a regular thing, because networking events like these are an important source of information. Information on where there is great need and information on how all Christians can meet this need. I hope this event is also an important source of encouragement, and an opportunity for missionaries and church people to build relationships valuable to fulfilling Christ's Great Commission.

Events like these certainly aren't unique to the missionary world. In my professional, vocational life I have a handful of high tech networking events I attend regularly. Industry people, from investors, to programmers, to designers, and everyone in between get together and discuss their ideas and build relationships. I recently attended one of these events here in Calgary. The first presenter described his recent trip to Silicon Valley for a Google Hackathon. A _Hackathon_ is an event where those gathered are given a problem and a limited time in which to solve it. He described Silicon Valley as a place where everyone you meet has a billion-dollar, world-changing idea. Whether you're in line for coffee, or you're at the dog park, if you strike up a conversation you are likely speaking to an expert in some field who has every expectation of reshaping some aspect of life or business. In the words of the presenter, Silicon Valley expects big vision. You wouldn't be there if you didn't have a billion dollar world changing idea.

We're here at the first ever Lutheran Missions Fest with the big vision and world-changing ideas. Not necessarily because we have to - though we do, because God calls - but rather because we want to. We want to change the world... imagine having no fresh water. Imagine having no school for your children. Imagine not knowing how to read and write. Imagine not knowing that Jesus died on the cross for our sins. We're all here today because we have big vision, handed down by God. Missionaries change the world. Who wouldn't want to be a part of that?

My name is Daniel Bidulock. I am a Web Developer and Wycliffe Bible Translator. Wycliffe has big vision and we are changing the world. Our basic mission is the same handed down to all Christians by Christ himself. We call this the Great Commission. Our role in this is in writing the Bible in the languages that have no Scripture. Of roughly 7,000 languages spoken in the world today, 2,000 are like these. Roughly 2,000 minority language groups have no access to the written Word of God. The Good News. The Good News changes the world. The Good News changes lives. Bible translation changes lives. But even before God's Good News can be written down, people need to learn to read and write. Wycliffe impacts real lives in ways that are impossible to quantify or contain.

Still to this day, there are many living languages that cannot be written down. The impact of introducing literacy and its basic tools to a minority or indigenous culture is world changing. Christ gave Wycliffe its big vision... He sent us out to change the world. Bible translation changes lives and adds value everywhere it goes. Bible translation introduces education, economy, and equality. 

As a Web Developer, I have been called as a missionary to direct my full focus to Bible translation. It is a tremendous blessing and privilege. There's a job waiting for me when I raise 100% of my financial support.

My first assignment with SIL-Wycliffe will likely be [ScriptureForge](https://scriptureforge.org). This is a sensible fit, as ScriptureForge is a Web application and I am a Web Developer. I write software for delivery over the World Wide Web. This application allows native speakers to provide feedback to Bible translators, so Christ's truth can be most fully expressed. Every language, no matter how many people speak it, is fully capable of expressing God's truth.  

No matter who you are, or where you go to church, you already have a responsibility. Not everyone is going to serve in India. Not everyone will translate Bibles. But we all have a role to play in carrying out the Great Commission, and this is where I have something to offer you. Partnering with me and Wycliffe allows you to participate directly in an expectionally worthy cause. I bring an opportunity to honor the Lord with your sacrfices. This is an opportunity to be blessed.

I, like all Wycliffe missionaries, can only do our work through your generosity. Serving minority language groups requires generosity. When you give to me through Wycliffe or Patreon, you are investing in Kingdom building work. You are sacrificing to God. Money by itself cannot share the Good News. Money by itself cannot bring literacy to a minority people. God takes your money and returns things money can't buy.


Ask God how you are to serve. Ask Him where to invest your time and money. As a Wycliffe Bible Translator, I bring an investment opportunity. By investing in my work, you are investing in eternity. You are inviting an opportunity to be blessed by God.
