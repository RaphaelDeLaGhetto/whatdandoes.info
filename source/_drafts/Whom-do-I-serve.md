My name is Daniel Bidulock. According to the _specifics_ of my job description, I am a Language Software Developer for an NGO call [SIL International](https://sil.org). In broader terms, most people know me as a [Wycliffe Bible Translator](https://wycliffe.ca).

Lots of people know Wycliffe. Fewer know SIL. Founded 1934, our purpose is to study, develop, and document languages. Of over 7000 living languages spoken on earth today, [as many as 3000](https://www.ethnologue.com/enterprise-faq/how-many-languages-world-are-unwritten-0) cannot be written down. When a civilization comes to the point where they want to be able to record their own stories, SIL International is there to serve that need.

In the simplest terms, language development is _literacy_. We know the consequences of _illiteracy_ to be disasterous. This is true on both the individual level, and at the level of society. SIL International provides the fundamental tools of basic literacy to people who would otherwise be marginalized and forgotten.

Some of what we create includes:

- New alphabets for the languages that cannot be written down
- Physical and on-screen computer keyboards to write with these new alphabets
- Literacy apps to teach people how to read and write

SIL International serves civilizations who want to be lifted up. Together, in partnership with these people, we literally write history. More importantly, we bring God's Word so they know to look to the cross and see that Jesus loves them.

SIL International also serves Bible translators all around the world. Of some you may have heard, like the Lutheran Bible Translators, the Jesus Film Project, and of course the Wycliffe Global Alliance. There are many more. We create the software tools used by Bible translation agencies. Together we serve God by carrying out Christ's Great Commission. 

I serve through SIL International. I am a computer programmer who writes software for the World Wide Web. I hold a Master of Divinity from Ambrose Seminary and a Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of Calgary. God prepared me and called me to serve. Until I'm called elsewhere, there is no better use of my time apart from Bible translation. Unless I'm called elsewhere, I'll be doing Bible translation until I die. As a living testimony to the power of God's Word, I am privileged to be allowed to serve this way.

I didn't grow up in a Christian home. We didn't go to church. My parents didn't really go to church either. Their families were _Christmas and Easter church-goers_, at best. Despite this, God put in me a desire to know the truth. With a sincere heart and mind for this knowledge, I reached out and God gave me his Word on comic book Bible tracts I found at the bus stop. Though foreign and hilariously offensive to my pagan sensibilities, I soon saw that God's Word is written all around us. I heard His voice in everything, including movies, music, and television. I gave my life to Jesus on July 28, 2003 because of comic books.

Seventeen years later, I read four Bible chapters every day. Starting in January, I finish the entire Bible by October 24th. This gives me enough time to do a second pass of the New Testament. I finish this on December 27th. This year, I am on my thirteenth front-to-back reading of the Bible and have completely lost track of the English translations I've covered. My first and favourite is the New Living Translation. Of those on my bookshelf, I've read the New International Version, the New American Standard Bible, the New Catholic Edition, the New Revised Standard Version, the Hebrew-English Holy Scriptures, and the Old and New King James version. I'm currently reading the Amplified version on [biblegateway.com](https://www.biblegateway.com/). I have not read the Bible on paper for at least seven years.

For those of use who learned English first, we are blessed with a rich legacy of Bible translations (there are more than 450 according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_translations_into_English). God's Word is written all around us. If we want to know the truth, we can reach out any time and take hold of it. You read the Bible and see through all the lies. Though I am uniquely qualified to serve God through SIL and Wycliffe, I serve primarily as a living testimony to the power of God's Word.

Witnessing to Christ, I serve my neighbours who can reach out, take hold of God's Word, and meet Jesus any time they want. As a Bible translator I serve those who cannot do the same. People for whom no Bible exists. After centuries of work, we have 450 English Bibles. There are over 2000 languages for which not even a single verse has been translated. No finding comic book Bible tracts at the bus stop for these people. I serve these people as a living testimony to the power of God's Word.

It takes decades of missionary work to get to the point where we are invited to help record a language on paper. Christian missionaries do this. We are unique in that we recognizeevery language can express the same truth. These missionaries devote their lives to sharing Christ's Good News. It takes a call from God to raise up Christians in places where there are none. It takes time and dedication to build a community who has heard God's Word, and sees the importance of being able to write it down. It takes time and dedication to raise up people within this community who want to raise their children in a better culture, translate the Bible, and write their stories in eternity.

It takes a long time to get to this point. This is where Bible translators step in. I serve translators from all agencies, all over the world. They use SIL software to carry out their missions. They build up communities with God's Word and with literacy. The consequences of illiteracy - inequality, poverty, ignorance, dependency, frustration, crime, violence - all these give way to equality, economy, and education. Life is better where there are Christians. People are set free to build up their homes and communities. But none of this matters when measured against what is offered by the Bible itself. To education, equality, and economy we add _eternity_. Let all those with ears to hear listen: look to the cross. Jesus loves you.

Before computers - even before basic word processing - a translation project could easily take 40 years. Now, a Bible translation project takes as little as ten. SIL serve the missionary translators by providing the tools that allow them to do more work, more efficiently. Wycliffe's goal is to have a Bible in the process of translation for every language by 2025.

That goal was set twenty years ago. For those who prayerfully considered this pledge, I'm sure it seemed like a long time off. We have five years left... God has revealed technology to achieve this. 

I serve SIL software developers, my colleagues. SIL International are leaders in language development. We are leaders in the work we do and in the tools we provide. I went to Dallas for our 2-year world-wide conference last year. I had not been surrounded by so many _actual_ Computer Scientists since grad school. Computer Science is discovering which problems can be solved with machines. The observation, hypothesis, and proof of the science is emboddied in the very existence of the program. The SIL scientists I met each have a long legacy of world-changing missionary service. It is an honour to count myself as one of them.

While we are leaders, we have fallen behind in how we provide our tools to Bible translators in the field. SIL software typically runs on desktop computers. This software has been the backbone of Bible translation for decades. But remember, the people we serve are the ones who do the _real_ translation work. Most of these people don't have desktop computers. They have mobile phones. SIL International has fallen behind. Most of our software can't be used on a phone.

I serve my SIL colleagues by example. Web Developers write software that you can use on your phone. I have been a professional Web Developer since my first salaried position at a local company called iStockPhoto.com. Whether it's on Google Chrome or something you download from the App Store, that is a program written by a Web Developer. Those are the programs we are now just starting to build. The wonderful thing about Web Development is how fast it moves. In eight years, there have been two obvious revolutions in the industry. SIL is at the dawn of a revolution. We are now writing our software for the Web. The people we serve - those who need a Bible that speaks to the language of their hearts - will be able to use their phones to do the work of translation. All over the world, people have computers in their pockets. We are building software so that all these people can come together in a way that has never been done in Bible translation. SIL are leaders. We will be the first.

I serve my colleagues by showing how it's done. I have set the lead in how SIL develops for the Web. They will follow, and our talented programmers will find even better ways, better practices, and provide better translation tools. This is Web Development. It is fast-paced and collaborative. Our goal is to have every Bible in translation by 2025. Five years gives time for two revolutions. Hundreds of millions of lives will be impacted in the next five years alone.

Day to day, this is how I serve God directly, by serving my colleagues at SIL. Together we write history, build civilizations, and invite God's people to write their stories in eternity.

I serve one more special group of people. My partners. These are people who recognize the value of the work we do, and recognize the opportunity to invest some of what God has given them. They see the opportunity to invest in building His Kingdom. I serve my partners in prayer and by sharing in the joy of doing God's work. My ministry as a missionary involves setting an example of Biblical financial stewardship and by leading others in knowing the joy of giving.

It sounds corny, but since being called to service, Christmas has taken on a whole new dimension. For me, being supported by so many revealed they joy of expressing gratitude. I had never written a Christmas before joining Wycliffe. Though it is a joy to receive, this last Christmas provided an interesting opportunity to know the joy of giving. I have been a faithful tither since my second year of seminary. This has been my most consistent act of worship in my Christian walk. I've never given begrudgingly, but I confess to often giving with little thought or prayer.

With all the Christmas I write, my family gets ramped up for Christmas in November. While going to an appointment downtown, I passed an elderly woman sitting on her walker outside an apartment block. She wasn't homeless, but I could tell she was in need. In the moment, I thought it strange she didn't have a sign or ask for money. The next moment God told me to give her $100. I hurried off to find a bank machine, praying all the while I'd reach her time.

I introduced myself to Helen and asked if she needed help. She told me about her sister dying of cancer in Ontario and how there was no way for her to go visit. The sadness on her face told the rest. I asked if I could pray, but I could tell she didn't see much point. I showed her five folded up twenties and asked if she could use the money. She gratefully accepted the gift, though I know she thought I'd only handed her twenty dollars. I asked if she had a purse to keep it safe and she then realized it was far more than what she had expected. The joy and surprise on her face told a different story. I did end up praying for her sister, and went off to my appointment.

Two weeks before Christmas I spotted Helen again. And once again, God told me to give her $100. I laughed internally, thinking it was all in my head. _No way God wants that_. Immediately He said, _Give her $200_. That's a lot of money for me. I didn't want to test God's patience and see if He'd make it $400.

I dutifully went and retrieved the money from the bank machine and walked up the street toward Helen. I was surpised to find her talking to a taxi driver, but he wasn't helping her into a cab, he was buying a hand-knit scarf. Helen had a large Tupperware of hand-knit goods. She recognized me when I asked about her sister. Her face told a happier story than when we first met. Helen's sister still had cancer, but her condition had improved. And Helen's small business was doing quite well. At $25/touque and $40/scarf, her inventory was moving. I even bought a few pieces for gifts, which she gave to me in a hand-coloured Christmas-themed paper bag. When I handed her four folded fifty dollar bills, I could tell by her face that she was going to visit her sister. Before I left, I prayed that God would continue to shine His light in Helen's life.

We are now much more prayerful in how we tithe and I now testify to a joy I hadn't really known before. In total I gave a woman I do not know $300. This is a lot of money for my family. Not only was it Christmas, we were frantically saving for a new vehicle. Our old van was undrivable. We could not _afford_ to give away money like this, especially on top of regular tithes. As a scientist, I claim no causation, but there was perhaps correllation when some new empty-nesters gifted us their old 2008 Honda Odyssey mini van. God is so good. This was life-changing for my family. Not only did it release us from the financial burden of saving for a new vehicle, it allows us to be even more generous. I have more testimony unfolding, which I hope to share another time. Living in His abundance doesn't necessarily always mean having a lot of cash.

As a missionary, I bring an opportunity to invest. I bring an opportunity to know God in way you might not have known before. I will likely never know more of Helen's story, but my family is blessed to be a part of it. Serving with SIL, I may never learn about the aboriginal kid in South East Asia who finds a comic book at the bus stop, but I know he's out there, and we are blessed to be a part of it. You can be a part of this too. The neat thing about it is, you can be part of my family's story and see directly how you impact our lives by enabling us to serve with Wycliffe and SIL International. I am blessed to serve my partners in prayer and by sharing our joy.

Peace be with you,

Dan

Of all the people





 God, I pray my neighbours reach out, and I pray they receive your Word. They can do this, whenever they want. God's Word is written all around us.




 Sometimes when I walk through my neighbourhood I can feel the despair and hopelessness in the homes I pass. Neighbours all around, packed in rows so close, yet isolated. Loneliness, pointlessness, hurt, and disgust. I don't know my neighbours, but I know each and every one of them needs Jesus. I reached out and God gave me his Word on comic book Bible tracts I found at the bus stop. God, I pray my neighbours reach out, and I pray they receive your Word. They can do this, whenever they want. God's Word is written all around us.

Hundreds of millions of people are reaching out to God, but there are no words they understand. There is no Bible to tell them the story in they language they speak in their head and heart. At best, they may find Christianity expressed in the words of the people who conquered them. From this, only God's Word, Jesus Christ, can set them free. Only God's Word can lift up people and civilizations.

I serve these people, our neighbours, those around me and those around the world, by writing software for the World Wide Web. I read four Bible chapters every day. Starting in January, I finish the entire Bible by October 24th. This gives me enough time to do a second pass of the New Testament. I finish December 27th. This year, I am on my thirteenth full-pass of the Bible. I have completely lost track of the English translations I've covered. My first and favourite is the New Living Translation. I'm currently reading the Amplified version. For those of use who learned English first, we are blessed with a rich legacy of Bible translations (more than 450 according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_translations_into_English).







In Canada, we know what happens when people are pushed aside like this. Look to the aboriginal communities around us. We call them _First Nations_, because at one time, they were independent, sovereign people. In the interests of peace, North America's aboriginal people signed treaties they couldn't read with names they couldn't write. One one side of these contracts you can read the names of those representating the British Crown. On the other side, you see _X_s or hand-drawn pictures of animals representing tribal leaders. To make matters worse, [the oral tradition maintained by tribal elders often doesn't match what is actually recorded on paper in the treaties](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/treaties-from-1760-1923-two-sides-to-the-story-1.1081839). Tribal leaders were told the document said something that it didn't. First Nations tell the stories of what happened, but they didn't write it down. 

Two to three hundred years later we are still living with consequence of pre-literate, indigenous societies being steam-rolled by a colonial superpower. The consequences of illiteracy are disasterous.
