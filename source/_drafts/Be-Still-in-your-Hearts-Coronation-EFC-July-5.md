A week ago I received a text message from my friend, Thomas. He asked if wanted to come to his church and talk about my work as a Bible translator. I said, _Heck yeah!_, and so here I am. Even before talking to your pastor on the phone, I got to praying... I asked God, what message do you have for the Evangelical Free Church in Coronation, Alberta? His response was immediate and clear. God's message for you is:

_Be still in your hearts_.

Speaking in front of a church is serious business. God help me if I don't deliver His unadulterated message! And so I prayed again... _Thank you, God for giving me this opportunity and this responsibility. Please let me hear You. Give me the words and guide my hand. What message will you have me deliver to Coronation?_ And He said,

_Let your hearts be at peace_.

<!-- more -->

This is God's message to you. 

I pray like this all the time. Maybe you do too. Sometimes I pray and I don't really get an answer. Or sometimes I can't tell the difference between God and that voice in my own head that's just telling me what I want to hear. Then there are times when I turn to prayer and I get an answer even before I pose the question. It's good when this happens, even though the answer may bring no peace. The answer may even invite hardship or some other difficulty.  

So how can my heart be still when God is telling me to do something I know is going to invite a whole heap of trouble? How can my heart be still when I can't sleep at night. I toss and turn because of trouble coming my way. How can I come to your church and tell you that God wants you to _Be still in your hearts_, when my own heart is often in terrible turmoil?

It's easy to give the _spiritual_ answer... let your heart be at peace, because you cannot fail with God right there beside you! I testify to this. As a missionary, I have no choice but to accept it, because I cannot carry the burden all by myself. My mission is impossible unless God gives me what I need. But even having witnessed God at work firsthand, the _spiritual_ answer offers little comfort, especially in the middle of the night when the trouble caused by my obedience stirs up turmoil in my own heart.

I'm sure there are people here today who share this experience. You may say, _I've been obedient. I did what I was told. God abandoned me and now I'm suffering the consequence_. So how can I say, _be still in your hearts_ when my own heart is often in turmoil? When I posed this question to God, and He led me to the Book of Matthew, Chapter 11.

> When Jesus had finished giving these instructions to his twelve disciples, he went out to teach and preach in towns throughout the region. John the Baptist, who was in prison, heard about all the things the Messiah was doing. So he sent his disciples to ask Jesus, "Are you the Messiah we've been expecting, or should we keep looking for someone else?" [Matthew 11:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+11%3A1-3&version=NLT):

If anyone had reason for inner turmoil, it would be John the Baptist. His arrest was first mentioned in Matthew 4:12, seven chapters before he sent his disciples to questions Jesus. Depending on who you ask, some say John was expressing his doubts about Jesus. Others say he was doing this for the benefit of his followers so that they would forget about John and follow Jesus instead. There may be some truth in both viewpoints. Though John had immediately recognized Jesus as the Messiah and had even performed His baptism, he now found himself in jail. Why couldn't the Messiah save him now?

Unlike Jesus, John didn't wasn't arrested because of his preaching and teaching. It was because of a local ruler named Herod Antipas. King Herod had paid a visit to his brother in Rome and seduced his brother’s wife. He then came home to Galilee, divorced his own wife, and married his sister-in-law. John was in jail because he publicly rebuked a despotic ruler. We don't know for sure, but given John's stature as a prophet, he was probably just relaying God's message. And given what Jesus Christ said about John, we know that He was pleased with his life and ministry.

> "I tell you the truth, of all who have ever lived, none is greater than John the Baptist. Yet even the least person in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he is! And from the time John the Baptist began preaching until now, the Kingdom of Heaven has been forcefully advancing, and violent people are attacking it. For before John came, all the prophets and the law of Moses looked forward to this present time. And if you are willing to accept what I say, he is Elijah, the one the prophets said would come. Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand! [Matthew 11:11-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+11%3A11-15&version=NLT).

I doubt I could pick a favourite prophet, but if forced to choose, Elijah would be a top candidate. He brought drought, raised the dead, called down holy fire from heaven, and slaughtered more false prophets than any ordinary man could stomach. Though at the forefront of an unparalled ministry that brought an entire kingdom to its knees, even Elijah had his own struggles with hardship and fear. Having rebuked King Ahab and Queen Jezebel so powerfully, he was suddenly gripped with fear and fled into the wilderness where he prayed:

> "I have had enough, Lord," he said. "Take my life, for I am no better than my ancestors who have already died." [1 Kings 19:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+19%3A4&version=NLT)

From there the angel of God gave him food and water and sent him on a 40 day journey to Mount Sinai where he slept in a cave. One of God's greatest prophets had no peace in his heart. Finally, God himself came to him and asked "What are you doing here, Elijah?" [1 Kings 19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings+19&version=ESV). To which he replied,

> "I have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts. For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword, and I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away."

God's message to you is _Be still in your hearts_. Imagine if he told the same thing to Elijah and John the Baptist. Empty words, perhaps, but that's not what God told them. To Elijah, who was hiding in a cave and feeling terribly sorry for himself, God said "Go out and stand on the mount before the Lord". And so God passed by, and with him he brought a strong wind powerful enough to tear the mountain apart. And then an earthquake. And then a fire. Elijah stood outside the cave and each time these powerful forces swept by, God was not in their midst. Then finally, there was a low whisper and God asked him again... "What are you doing here, Elijah?" To which, once again, Elijah gave his same lament: _I did what you told me to do, and now I'm being hunted!_

We can be sure that God heard Elijah's despair, though He doesn't acknowledge it. He simply gives Elijah new marching orders, which Elijah dutifully carries out. He commissions a new prophet and embarks on some new adventures before being swept up into heaven on chariot fire (2 Kings 2). 

Elijah and John the Baptist had a lot in common. They both offended the rulers of the day. They both spent considerable time in the wilderness. They both even dressed the same, wearing leather belts and garments made of hair (Matthew 3:4, 2 Kings 1:8). There is an immediate and obvious difference, however. While Elijah avoided death by being carried up to heaven, John was decapitated because of a foolish pledge made by a lecherous, adulterous king. There's at least one other difference as well. It's in how God responds to each man's turmoil. In Elijah's case, God simply tells him to get back to work. In contrast, Jesus tells John's disciples:

> "Go back to John and tell him what you have heard and seen - the blind see, the lame walk, those with leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, and the Good News is being preached to the poor." And he added, "God blesses those who do not fall away because of me." [Matthew. 11:4-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+11%3A4-6&version=NLT)

To paraphrase, _Yeah, obviously I'm Messiah_.

> Then Jesus began to denounce the towns where he had done so many of his miracles, because they hadn’t repented of their sins and turned to God. [Matt. 11:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+11%3A20&version=NLT) 

Judgement is coming for those who can see with their own eyes and still don't believe. Incredibly, Christ gives thanks for this:

> "O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, thank you for hiding these things from those who think themselves wise and clever, and for revealing them to the childlike. Yes, Father, it pleased you to do it this way! "My Father has entrusted everything to me. No one truly knows the Son except the Father, and no one truly knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him." [Matthew 11:25-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+11%3A25-27&version=NLT)

If you're one of those who thinks himself _wise and clever_, this will bring no peace to your heart:

**You cannot know God apart from Christ.**

> Then Jesus said, "Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you. Let me teach you, because I am humble and gentle at heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy to bear, and the burden I give you is light." [Matthew 11:29-30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+11%3A28-30&version=NLT)

It's made all that much harder for those of us here today, who have never seen a miracle, have never heard God's voice, who maybe have no reason to believe that God walked amongst us and died for our sins, who maybe don't believe in any god at all.

It's made all that much harder for those of us here today who regularly witness miracles, hear God's voice, who worship the God who walked amongst us, said I know your suffering, I know you didn't ask for anything of this, I know you're hurt and angry, do with Me what you will, I forgive you.

My heart is often in turmoil. I'm here today to tell you, _Be still in your hearts_. Look to the cross and know that Jesus loves you.
