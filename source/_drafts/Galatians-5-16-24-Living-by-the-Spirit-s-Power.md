## The Christmas Spirit

I got into the Christmas Spirit early this year, because for the first time ever, I sent out Christmas cards. As a Wycliffe Bible Translator, my work is enabled by people who make donations and pledge regular financial support. I had many people to thank, because many have made generous contributions to my missionary fund. Far from being a chore, being called to say Thank You to so many people is a tremendous blessing. All praise to God for bringing me this joy this Christmas season.

I don't know that people talk much about the Christmas Spirit anymore. If you mention it, people will know what you mean, but may not agree about what the Christmas Spirit is. For those who celebrate Christmas as the birth of Jesus, it's safe to say the Christmas Spirit is Christ's own Holy Spirit. For those who celebrate the holidays in a different way, I couldn't say for sure... from old movies I get the impression that the Christmas Spirit is usually some vague notion of warm feelings radiating from deep inside the heart.

Whatever your notion of the Christmas holidays, this day has long been set aside to mark the birth of God's only son, Jesus Christ. He was born of the Virgin Mary to step-father Joseph in the town of Bethlehem. The Creator's word became flesh. He entered his own creation as a baby boy. The greatest story ever told starts at Christmas. The Christmas Spirit carries this story like music on the wind and brings deep hope and joy to those who know the story is true.

Share the story and receive the Christmas Spirit. Celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ and become part of the story yourself. Let your spirit grow through the good stories people tell about you. The Christmas Spirit is the story of God the Father and how he gave us the only gift that matters, Jesus Christ his son. 

Of course, Jesus' birth isn't the only story we tell at Christmas. We all have our own stories. Some are happy. Some are sad. It can be hard to get into the Christmas Spirit when your own story is marked by sadness. But even a sad story can be a good one. This is the hope and joy that the Christmas Spirit brings. Live by the Spirit and a bad story becomes good.

## Galatians 5:1,13-26

^1^ It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.

^13^ You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love. ^14^ For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” ^15^ If you bite and devour each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.

^16^ So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. ^17^ For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want. ^18^ But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.

^19^ The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; ^20^ idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions ^21^ and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.

^22^ But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, ^23^ gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. ^24^ Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. ^25^ Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. ^26^ Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.

## Life by the Spirit

Paul's letter to the Galatians was written decades after Jesus left us his Holy Spirit. The Galatian church of the time were being led to believe that if you wanted to follow Christ, you had to submit to the Jewish laws. Paul wrote them a letter to explain that the Holy Spirit sets you free from the Law.

Paul tells us at the start of Galatians 5 that Jesus Christ has set us free. Be careful not to fall back into slavery to the law. Use your freedom to build your community up in love. Don't use it to satisfy your own selfish desires. Live by the Spirit, be set free from the law, and obey it all at the same time. The law, after all, can be summed up in one command, _Love your neighbor as yourself_^Gal 5:14^. Take advantage of your neighbour, and you set the stage for a darker story.

If you live by the Holy Spirit, you won't have bad stories because you will be showing love to your neighbours. The Spirit makes us want to write a better story. He wants us to leave the selfish things behind that hurt ourselves and others. Your own desires are in constant battle with the Spirit. Though free from the Law, we easily fall back into submission to our own sinful nature, which stops us from doing the good things inspired by the Spirit. Align yourself with the Spirit, and be free from the laws God gave through Moses.

Paul gives many examples of what it means to follow your own desires, those apart from the Holy Spirit. All manners of sexual immorality, witchcraft, hostility, greed, broken relationships, substance abuse, and other dangerous situations. Follow your desires apart from the Holy Spirit and the stories told of you will not be good. Let the Spirit guide you and find love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. The Spirit sets you free from the law because there are no laws against all these good things.

Living by the Spirit - belonging to Jesus - means nailing your sinful nature to the same cross upon which he died. Live by the Spirit and follow his lead. Stop being conceited, jealous, and hostile toward one another.

## Be a part of God's Story

How many have bad stories about a party that got too wild?

Contrary to what old movies tell us, the Christmas Spirit does not come from inside us.

# Prayer

God, give me the message for Tsuu T'ina and Calgary. Let Kevin Little Light exceed expectations. Let him manage well and be given more. Let me use my freedom to serve my neighbours with love.



The only power ghosts have over us are the stories we tell about them.

How the stories Jesus told changed the world
How the stories of Jesus have changed the world
How Jesus changes your story
How your story is told with Jesus' story


Christmas is a time of joy for some. It is hard for others. There are good spirits and bad. You see both in this passage:

Bad spirits:
Spirits of confusion, lying, suspicion

Good spirits:
Spirit of grace, truth, reconciliation.

_So I say, let the Holy Spirit guide your lives. Then you won’t be doing what your sinful nature craves._ v16

The Christmas Spirit does not come from inside us.

I believe it’s a deep-seated joy in knowing that the story of the Christ Child is gloriously true!
