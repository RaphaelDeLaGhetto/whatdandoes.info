Societal wisdom concerning what we call _screen time_ dictates that there is far too much of it. Especially for children. In my own household, it concerns me how quickly a computer of any shape or size - tablet, phone, or desktop - will consume my children's attention. As a parent, I have to be concerned.

I ask,

- What are they watching?
- What messages are they absorbing?
- Couldn't their time be spent doing other things?

Even being the parent and supervising consumption of such media, it is frustrating. But when I reflect, I realize my childhood was no different.

Only God knows the hours I spent in front of a 10 inch Sony Trinitron television as a boy. Back then in Calgary, we could pick up three TV channels on most days: CBC, CFCN, and Channel 2&7. We didn't have cable. Our signal arrived through the air to be received on bent and broken rabbit ear antennaes. My family still doesn't have cable, and I laugh because in your 500 channel cable universe, the number of channels I can now watch has doubled.

On Sunday evenings, my mom and dad would always watch the news magazine show, 60 Minutes. One of my earliest memories is witnessing my parent's surprise at learning John Lennon had been shot. By contrast, my children first came to know the music of the Beatles by watching baby shows on Kid's CBC. The drug-fueled rebels and rockstar revolutionaries of the 60s are now entertainers on early morning children's television. Parents and grandparents might now a show called the Beat Bugs. Hilariously, it has regular guest appearances by the rebels and rockers who excited my own 16 year-old own passions. Some of you may have heard of Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam. Great musicians spanning eras who time forced into the main stream.

And while I agree, both my children and myself watch way too much TV, it may be surprising to learn my seventy year-old father is no different. Unlike my mother, his family always had television, my mom only had radio. They both had newspapers of course, but even that medium comes and goes. Try making a papier mache volcano and see how far you get. This can only be done properly with newsprint, which is a rarity around our house today.

Despite this difference, my father and I are similar in the mediums toward which we each landed. Though the stories told of my father are fading and being forgotten, he taught Computer Science at the University of Calgary for nearly 30 years and has impacted the discipline and industry in ways we even he can never fully appreciate. He's legally blind now, a condition that is certainly part genetic and part due to staring at a screen for half his life.

I think even most young people remember the big, fat, heavy TVs we used to have. When I was young my mom used to say, _Danny, don't stand behind the TV! There's radiation!_. Even my dad used to laugh at her, even knowing that she was kind of right. In all likeliehood, the cathode rays from those old TVs and computer monitors are what slow-cooked his eyeballs. Doctors say he has the _dry_ kind of macular degeneration.

We shape this technology and it literally shapes us in return. We create the media, and it likewise shapes the message. Some mediums are better at expressing ideas, while others are better at expressing feelings. No matter your prefered medium, the same truth can be expressed. I don't see media as distinct from technology. They all shape how you tell a story and what stories are best told. They simultaneously enrich and injures our lives. Knowing how to avoid injury caused by media and their machines is no different than knowing how to avoid sin. You can't. You walk head-first, eyes open, and you crack your head on it.

Despite all this, I love media. I love consuming it. I love creating it. I love enriching my life and the lives of others. I love injuring evil through it. That said, even when I was young, it already had enslaved me. I have been watching TV, listening to the radio, and reading since I was able. Reading is no different than television. There's no intellectualism inherent in reading books. Readers and television-watchers are simply consuming media. For better or for worse. Communicating ideas and feelings as they are best equipped. Some say media is the natural consequence of using machines.

Look at the printing press and look at all the trouble it's caused. Should we get rid of it? Look at the stone tablets Moses carved. Think of the written word itself! The encoding of language. Should we get rid of literacy as well?

Obviously not.

I did get rid of one thing though... Facebook. Almost five years ago. Not because it injured me, but because I have been blessed with a wicked tongue, which makes it all too easy to injure others. Worse still, Facebook lets everyone make his own _fake news_, as we've come to call it. Like a media-savvy celebrity, you get to show off the bits and pieces you want everyone to see. You control the narrative of your life by constructing your own little media empire. You build an audience and earn Likes from likeminded Facebook consumers. If the medium is the message, Facebook is telling you that you can be a star. A celebrity. Too many of us love to hate all over celebrities. All I remember from Facebook five years ago is a lot of hate. The message lost by the medium is that when you started viewing people, friends and family, as media products to be consumed, we forget the person and only see the celebrity. 

No more Facebook for me.

The media isn't inherently evil, even social media. But yes, it is definitely lying to you. And yes, it's hard to sift through all those lies. Yet so many people trust themselves to make _informed decisions_. I was recently privy to a discussion concerning the media at a church men's group meeting. Speaking of the American election, one man said _we just all need to know the difference between what's true and fake_. When it's not the people, but the medium itself shaping the message, this is easier said than done. When you consume news, no matter the medium, the story is never just about the _who, what, where, why, and when_. Inevitably, it's _why the news reporter thinks the story is relevant and what action you (or the government) can take to ensure the story has an outcome the reporter deems favourable_. Like your wife on Instagram, the news outlet only shares the details they want everyone to know.

The news is important, but _relevance_ has nothing to do with the news. A nuclear melt-down in Japan has no relevance in my daily life. Civil unrest, or genocide in tribal Africa have no relevance to my life here in Southern Alberta. The events, the _who, what, where, when, and why_ are definitely important, but it's not because these events are _relevant_. The news is important simply because it happened. We don't need _context_ or _relevance_. We don't need to know how we can take action to appease the media, because we already know. We are Christians. We need to show compassion. We need to reflect God's glory. And most important of all, we need to pray. Incredibly, we don't do any of this out of obligation, but because we are thankful, and it's really the only way to live.

I didn't grow up in a Christian home. My mom recently told me, _the Good News is fake news_. She was upset with me because I didn't automatically accept CBC, CNN, and what all the bridge ladies were saying about the American election as the gospel truth. Having been born and raised in northern Saskatchewan, she never had TV. They had newspapers and radio when they had batteries. In one way, this may be a blessing upon my mother. On the other hand, she didn't have the benefit of a lifetime of media exposure to learn how each tells the same story differently. She understands when the reporter explains why the election is _relevant_. She understands that if people don't _take action_ there will be an unfavourable outcome. Ask her about the _Good News_ and she will say it is fake. 

To be fair, it is kind of irrelevant to my parents. They're old, but are in reasonably good health, financially secure, and able to enjoy their remaining days entirely apart from the joy of knowing the Good News. It's irrelevant, and somehow relevance supersedes the truth. If it's not relevant, then it's not important. But like a nuclear meltdown, _relevance_ has nothing to do with the truth. It happened and it's important for reasons we cannot escape, be it the radioactive tang in our honey, or that by ourselves we cannot reconcile with God.



We try to decide between good and evil, right and wrong, true and false. We try to tell a story apart from the Greatest Story Ever Told. We can't change what's written in stone or deep down in our hearts.


The Good News that Jesus died on the cross for our sins isn't relevant to my parent, but it did happen and it is important.

And if you still think it's fake news, then I have no choice but to trust that you can decide between what's true and fake.

P.s., I don't.

Christianity hinges on historical fact. If Jesus didn't die at the hands of Roman executioners and come back to life three days later, then yes, the Good News is fake news. I personally have wasted my life. I'm totally wrong about everything. What a dummy I am.



It's totally fake that God created me and all people in His image, to live with Him in eternity. It's fake 






I have no choice




And it's not like Christians aren't immune from making fake news. Watch YesTV. I thank God that we're not very good at it. It's all pointless anyway since we have the _Good News_.
irrelevant.

If you like watching the news, don't forget to pray for the people in their stories. Pray for the reporters too. Pray that amidst it all, the truth becomes obvious. 




There's no difference. It's all fake news. 




I could try reporting on why it's relevant and the action they might take to secure their lives in eternity, but my parents have no need for God's forgiveness. It's irrelevant to how they're living now.

And yet, like all news, it's important because it happened. Christianity hinges on the fact that God entered his own creation, was derided by the spiritual and political authorities of the time, executed by professional Roman executioners, spoke forgiveness with his dying breath, and came back to life three days later saying the exact same thing. I love you. I forgive you. Come be with me in eternity, if you want.

If this is fake news, then all this is pointless.




Jesus loves you and if you love Him back, you already know your part no matter the _who, what, where, and when_. Why? If you don't know _why_, you know where to start looking for answers.





For me, it was the Word of God who revealed the lie to me. 


Those who know me, know that comic books played a huge part in recognized God's Truth. My first exposure to the Scripture came in single verses at the end of some abrasive Jack Chick comic book Bible tracts. Having read the stories, and read the verses, the seed was planted and fell on rich soil. I began to hear God's voice in all the media I love: movies, music, and television.

The world is not so scary a place when you have your ear tuned to the Good News. You hear it in everything, while immediately sifting through the devil's lies. You turn to the Good News first, you turn to the Scriptures, and you immediately recognize how few things are truly _unprecedented_.
