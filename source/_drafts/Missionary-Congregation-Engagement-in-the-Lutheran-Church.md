This post is motivated by the need to build relationships between self-funded missionaries and Lutheran churches within the [CALC](https://calc.ca) denomination. A missionary seeking financial support within CALC is hindered by a lack of expectation and process. How does a missionary build relationships with a congregation? How do we engage and support a missionary raised up from within CALC? In laying out a tentative roadmap, I hope to help answer these questions.

## Prayer

Building relationships is closely akin to Kingdom Building. When God calls a missionary to service, the missionary trusts God to provide material necessities. In raising financial support, everything must be prayerfully directed. In building relationships with congregations, God will call those He has chosen to partner. Diligent prayer is to be assumed at every stop on the engagement roadmap.

## Basic Questions

There are at least two fundamental questions that need to be answered before the thoughtful individual will turn to prayer. These are simply, _Who is this missionary, and why is his work important?_

### Who is this missionary?

It is likely that a missionary has little personal reach beyond his home congregation. Though he may be heavily involved in service and ministry, any reputation or influence garnered by such involvement may not carry weight between congregations, especially when separated by distance. A missionary must be introduced to a new congregation by someone known and respected. This may be a pastor, councillor, or some other leader. Whatever role this leader plays, she must be introduced to the work.

Relationship-building with a congregation begins with its leadership. This begins with the missionary being allowed to share testimony and the purpose of the work to which he is called.

### Why is the mission important?

Having built relationship and credibility with a church leader, the missionary needs to share with those who may be called to support him (i.e., the congregation). This could happen in a number of ways, though being allowed to speak during Sunday service seems natural if distance is not a factor. Whatever the mode of communication, this is the missionary's opportunity to demonstrate the value and impact of his work. This prepares the congregation to ask God if they are called to join the missionary in the Kingdom-building opportunity presented to them.

## Roadmap

In addressing the two _Basic Questions_ presented above, there are at least two factors to consider. This tentative roadmap seeks to address these:

- How do we announce a visiting missionary in advance of a visit to ensure key people are present?
  - _Key people_ include church leaders and individual families with a heart for missions.
- How do we emphasize the need for prayerful consideration of support?

### Video Introduction

I propose a two-week lead-up to any missionary church visit. During service, on the two Sunday's prior, a short promotional video will be played. Pre-announcing a visit in this way serves to answer the question of _Who exactly is this missionary?_ When the missionary does come to speak to the church, his visit will be expected and the congregation will have already been invited to prayerfully consider support.

### Bulletin Announcement

This may be done in lieu of, or in addition to a video introduction. This is especially important in cases where a church does not possess adequate audio-visual equipment. The announcement itself need not be verbose. By itself, it serves the same purpose as the video. It invites the congregation to ask God how to steward their individual and corporate finances.

#### Example:

```
Wycliffe missionary, Daniel Bidulock, will be joining us on ________ to share his testimony and call to Bible translation. Please ask God if you are called to invest in this exciting Kingdom-building opportunity.
```

### Sanctuary Screen Announcement

My home church shows announcement slides on the sanctuary screens before service. A single slide with a photo and arrival information reinforces the need for prayer in anticipation of a missionary's visit.

#### Example:

_Coming soon..._

### The Church Visit

Timing and placement within the overall service is a future point of discussion. With a ten minute presentation (for example), the missionary is given the opportunity to make a more robust self-introduction. The manner in which a missionary's work and testimony are presented are beyond the scope of this roadmap, though I would expect an audio-visual element where such ammenities are available. Slideshows and video content are examples of these elements.

#### Promotional Material

Brochures, prayer cards, and offering envelopes are distributed with the service bulletin. Having such materials in the hands of those present is important when it comes time to pray collectively as a congregation about financial support.

#### Corporate Prayer

Once the missionary has shared his work and testimony it is essential that someone leads the congregation in prayer. Ideally this should be the church leader to whom the missionary was first introduced, though the pastor or other person of influence is also good... just so long as there is prayer. The intended impact of the prayer must also be kept in mind. Depending on the sending agency, the missionary may not be able to start work until his financial support is proven 100% sustainable. Communicating immediacy and urgency is the difference between `If you're interested, talk to Dan after service` and `Ask God _now_ if you are called to join in this work`.

##### Example

```
In your bulletins you'll find a brochure and an offering envelope. Please hold these in your hand and bow with me in prayer...

God, thank you for this opportunity to invest in your Kingdom-building work around the world. Please direct our hearts and minds toward your purpose. Let our generosity do the work that money by itself cannot carry out. Let us join Dan in changing lives by publishing your Good News to the world.
```



## Future Work

### Distance

Given the distance between CALC churches, it may not be feasible for a missionary to visit each one in person. There may be other options open to someone invited to share mission and testimony, but this would depend on the technical prowess of each church. While most would likely be able to play an informational video, setting up a video conference may present more of a challenge.

### Identifying Individual Supporters in Advance
